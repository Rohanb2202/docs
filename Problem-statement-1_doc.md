# **Protein Molecule Scorecard Application**

## **Problem Definition**
The objective is to create an interactive protein molecule scorecard application that can be accessed online and used to study, evaluate, and visualize protein molecules. In addition to dynamically rendering a table of protein attributes and descriptors from a JSON file, the application will use Mol* (Molstar) for 3D visualization. Users will also be able to use color gradients and dropdown menus to investigate the features of individual molecules.

## **Users**
Students, bioinformaticians, and researchers who work with protein data are the main users.

- **How They Use It**:
1. You can either fetch pre-loaded data or upload JSON.
2. Look at a table that shows the scores and characteristics of proteins.
3. Select molecules to see in three dimensions by clicking the "View Structure" button.
4. To investigate the properties of molecules with dynamic color gradients, choose properties from a dropdown menu.

## **Plan**

### **Phase 1: Rendering Dynamic Tables**
- Create a responsive table from a JSON file by adding a "View Structure" button to each row and columns for protein attributes.
- Use property-based color labeling in table cells (red, amber, and green).

### **Phase 2: Integration of Mol* Viewers**
- In order to visualize protein molecules in three dimensions, incorporate the Mol* viewer into the user interface.
- Load molecular structures dynamically according to the protein of choice.

### **Phase 3: Visualization Properties**
- Provide a drop-down menu for choosing characteristics (such as charge and hydropathy).
- Use dynamic color gradients to draw attention to the characteristics of molecules.
- A color legend should be provided for the user's reference.

## **Milestones**
1. Color-coded table representation with buttons for structure view.
2. Dynamic structural loading and functional integration with the Mol* viewer.
3. Color gradients and dropdown-based property visualization.

## **Process for Development**
- **Version 0**: Simple table visualization using placeholder data.
- **Version 1**: The Mol* viewer is integrated functionally.
- **Final Version**: Dynamic updates and dropdown properties are included in this fully interactive display.

---

## **Exit Criteria**
The project is finished when:
- The table dynamically renders from JSON data with color-coded values.
- The Mol* viewer precisely loads and shows protein molecules.
- The display is dynamically updated with suitable color gradients through dropdown-based property selection.
- Every feature is user-friendly and responsive on all devices.

## **Project Deliverables**
1. **Working Application**:
A fully operational frontend deployed in a container using Docker via the bootcamp.aganitha.ai server, accessed through remote SSH.
2. **Documentation**:
   - A developer's roadmap for upcoming upgrades.
3. **Codebase**:
   - Modular and Reusable components and well-structured, commented code.
4. **Sample Dataset**:
   - JSON and PDB files for testing and illustration.
