# **Collaborative Annotation Framework**

## **Problem Definition**
Create a robust annotation platform that bridges AI and human interaction through a modular, extensible system. The platform will feature secure authentication, flexible component visualization, and comprehensive annotation capabilities, all built on a foundation of JSON-driven architecture.

---

## **Target Users**
**Primary Users**: Data scientists, AI researchers, and domain experts requiring collaborative data annotation capabilities.

### **Usage Flow**
1. Secure access via multi-factor authentication using auth.js.
2. Interact with dynamic data visualizations.
3. Collaborate through component-level annotations.
4. Build and customize composite visualization widgets.

## **Implementation Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Security Layer**
- Deploy Next.js framework with Auth.js integration.
- Implement dual authentication paths (credentials/OTP).
- Design a flexible session management system.

### **Phase 2: Component System**
- Establish a foundational component structure for data visualization.
- Implement a JSON-based system for defining components.
- Develop initial widget types, including:
  - Table view for CSV data.
  - Text-based display.
  - Graph visualization.
- Integrate support for component metadata and user-defined display preferences.

### **Phase 3: Composite Widgets**
- Enable the combination of multiple widgets into a unified interface.
- Develop a communication system to facilitate interaction between widgets.
- Create a composite widget example, such as a graph paired with a textual description.
- Add functionality for dynamically registering new widget types.

### **Phase 4: Annotation Engine**
- Design universal annotation capability.
- Create annotation lifecycle management.
- Implement server-side annotation storage.
- Enable granular component annotation.

---

## **Key Checkpoints**
- Robust authentication layer deployment.
- Flexible component system implementation.
- Universal annotation system integration.

---

## **Development Roadmap**
- **Initial Release**: Core authentication and basic components.
- **Intermediate Release**: Advanced component system.
- **Production Release**: Complete annotation integration.

---

## **Completion Requirements**
The system must demonstrate:
- Seamless authentication via multiple methods.
- Versatile data visualization capabilities.
- Comprehensive annotation support.
- Dynamic widget registration.
- Efficient server-side storage.
- Component-level granular annotations.

  in phase 4 mark it a question like  either the annotation should be stored on server sider where other peoples can see through our work or on client side
